Perspective Puzzle

A first-person puzzle game where perception shapes reality.
About

In Perspective Puzzle, players move through a series of rooms, each containing a unique puzzle. Objects on the walls appear as flat 2D decals, but when viewed from the correct angle, they transform into usable 3D objects. Solve puzzles by shifting your perspective and bringing hidden elements into reality.
